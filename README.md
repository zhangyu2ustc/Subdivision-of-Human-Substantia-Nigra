# Subdivision-of-Human-Substantia-Nigra
We investigated the anatomical and functional organization of the human substantia nigra (SN) using diffusion and functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project.  A tripartite connectivity-based parcellation of SN was identified with a limbic, cognitive, motor arrangement.
