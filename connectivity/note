the subregions served different functions. Considering that SN is highly involved in the reward circuits, we acquired the gambling task fMRI scans where brain response to monetary gains and losses were evaluated. Among SN subdivisions, we found a significant interaction effect between regions and rewarding or aversive conditions. Moreover, only medial SN showed a significant different response to wins and losses, while the other two subregions responded similarly to both conditions. Other target regions in ventral striatum, vmPFC, anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were alsoÂ estimated. Among which, both ventral striatum and vmPFC responded differently to rewarding and aversive stimuli, while insula and ACC showed similar response pattern to both conditions.
